## Features

blob-image is a command line script for Linux servers and desktops that helps automate the process of losslessly compressing JPEG and PNG images. Like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) and [Trimage](https://imageoptim.com), blob-image achieves maximum savings by running the source image through multiple compression libraries, brute-force-style. But unlike those programs, there are no GUI dependencies, so it can be installed without pulling in a bunch of extra crap. ;)


&nbsp;

## Requirements

blob-image has no GUI dependencies. All it requires is a Linux operating system and modern BASH shell.

Third-party utilities provide the actual compression magic. No single application is required, but for best results you should install each of the following:

#### PNG
 * [advpng](http://www.advancemame.it/doc-advpng.html)
 * [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng)
 * [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/)
 * [pngout](http://www.jonof.id.au/kenutils)

#### JPEG
 * [jpegoptim](http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/projects.html)
 * [jpegrescan](https://github.com/kud/jpegrescan)
 * [jpegtran](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg)


&nbsp;

## Installation

You can simply download the blob-image script and make it executable:

```bash
wget -O /usr/bin/blob-image https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobfolio/blob-image/master/blob-image && chmod +x /usr/bin/blob-image
```

Alternatively, `.deb` binaries are available via Blobfolio's APT repository for Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Artful. (Other Debian-based distributions may also work, but aren't officially supported.)

```bash
# Import the signing key.
wget -qO - https://apt.blobfolio.com/public.gpg.key | apt-key add -

# apt.blobfolio.com requires HTTPS connection support.
# This may or may not already be configured on your
# machine. If APT is unable to connect, install:
apt-get install apt-transport-https

# Debian Stretch.
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.blobfolio.com/debian/ stretch main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blobfolio.list

# Ubuntu Artful.
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.blobfolio.com/debian/ artful main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blobfolio.list

# Update APT sources.
apt-get update

# Install it!
sudo apt-get install blob-image
```

## Use

The following runtime flags are available:

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| -c, --color | Colorize output. |
| -d, --dry-run | Test compression without saving changes. |
| -h, --help  | Display documentation. |
| -l, --log *=/path*   | Log results to this path. Default: `/var/log/blob-image.log` |
| --max-age *=123* | Ignore files older (mtime) than this value (in minutes). |
| --min-age *=123* | Ignore files younger (mtime) than this value (in minutes). |
| --max-size *=123* | Ignore files larger than this value (in bytes). `K`, `M`, `G` units are allowed. | 
| --min-size *=123* | Ignore files smaller than this value (in bytes). `K`, `M`, `G` units are allowed. |
| -m, --multithreaded | Optimize performance for multithreaded systems. |
| -o, --overkill | By default jpegtran, advpng, and pngcrush are skipped when made redundant by MozJPEG or oxipng. Overkill Mode runs images through them anyway. |
| -q, --quiet | Do not throw anything to STDOUT. |
| --disable-advpng | Do not execute advpng. |
| --disable-jpegoptim | Do not execute jpegoptim. |
| --disable-jpegrescan | Do not execute jpegrescan. |
| --disable-jpegtran | Do not execute jpegtran. |
| --disable-oxipng | Do not execute oxipng. |
| --disable-pngcrush | Do not execute pngcrush. |
| --disable-pngout | Do not execute pngout. |
| --skip-jpeg | Do not process JPEG images. |
| --skip-png | Do not process PNG images. |

```bash
# blob-image [-args] [file/dir] [file/dir]...
blob-image -cm /home/josh/Pictures/foo.jpeg
