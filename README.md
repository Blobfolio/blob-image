## Features

blob-image is a command line script for Linux servers and desktops that helps automate the process of losslessly compressing JPEG and PNG images. Like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) and [Trimage](https://imageoptim.com), blob-image achieves maximum savings by running the source image through multiple compression libraries, brute-force-style. But unlike those programs, there are no GUI dependencies, so it can be installed without pulling in a bunch of extra crap. ;)



## Requirements

blob-image has no GUI dependencies. All it requires is a Linux operating system and BASH shell.

Third-party utilities provide the actual compression magic. No single application is required, but for best results you should install each of the following:

#### PNG
 * [advpng](http://www.advancemame.it/doc-advpng.html)
 * [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)
 * [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/)
 * [PNGOUT](http://www.jonof.id.au/kenutils)

#### JPEG
 * [jpegoptim](http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/projects.html)
 * [jpegrescan](https://github.com/kud/jpegrescan)



## Installation

You can simply download the blob-image script and make it executable:

```bash
wget -O /usr/bin/blob-image https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobfolio/blob-image/master/blob-image && chmod +x /usr/bin/blob-image
```

Alternatively, `.deb` binaries are available via Blobfolio's APT repository for Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Zesty. (Other Debian-based distributions may also work, but aren't officially supported.)

```bash
# Import the signing key
wget -qO - https://apt.blobfolio.com/public.gpg.key | apt-key add -

# apt.blobfolio.com requires HTTPS connection support.
# This may or may not already be configured on your
# machine. If APT is unable to connect, install:
apt-get install apt-transport-https

# Debian Stretch
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.blobfolio.com/debian/ stretch main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blobfolio.list

# Ubuntu Zesty
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.blobfolio.com/debian/ zesty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/blobfolio.list

# Update APT sources
apt-get update

# Install it!
sudo apt-get install blob-image
```



## Use

The following runtime flags are available:

> -q
> Suppress STDOUT

> -mt
> Use multi-threading

> -f */path/to/file*
> Compress a single file

> -d */path/to/directory*
> Recursively search *directory* for JPEG/PNG images and compress them all

```bash
# example
blob-image -f /home/josh/Pictures/foo.jpeg
```

Results are logged to `/var/log/blob-image.log`. The log file must be writeable by the user executing the blob-image script. If logging doesn't work, you can try:

```bash
sudo touch /var/log/blob-image.log
sudo chown yourusername: /var/log/blob-image.log
```
